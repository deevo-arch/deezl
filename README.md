## Technical Architecture

### Services
- **YouTubeService**: Handles API calls to YouTube for searching and trending music
- **AudioService**: Manages audio playback using Howler.js
- **useAudioPlayer**: Custom hook for player state management

### Components
- **Player**: Full-featured audio player with controls
- **SearchBar**: Real-time search with YouTube integration
- **HomeView**: Trending and recommended music display
- **TrackCard**: Interactive music cards with play buttons
- **Queue**: Queue management with visual feedback

### Audio Integration

The platform uses Howler.js for audio playback. For production use, you would integrate:

1. **yt-dlp**: For extracting audio URLs from YouTube videos
2. **Lavalink**: For scalable audio streaming
3. **Backend API**: To handle audio extraction and streaming

### Current Implementation

- Uses YouTube API for music discovery and metadata
- Implements fallback audio for demonstration
- Ready for integration with real audio extraction services
- Includes proper error handling and loading states

## Production Considerations

For a production deployment, you would need to:

1. **Backend Integration**: Set up a backend service that uses yt-dlp or similar tools to extract audio streams
2. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure proper licensing for music streaming
3. **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed tracks
4. **CDN**: Use a CDN for serving audio content
5. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and personalization
